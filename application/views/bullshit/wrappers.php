<h2>
  What are the wrappers?
</h2>
<p>
  The wrappers are portions of code which should make youre life easier through giving you key portions of your bot (such as the socket connector). This is not a competition on programming after all as much as it is a competition based on the logic you implement for your bot. We want you to be able to hit the ground running and get something going quickly not spend a lot of time fighting errors attempting to connect to our system.
</p>
<p>
  Below are a few wrappers which we have provided for you. However, if you feel you must you can always write one for yourself which will, of course, take more time to complete.

The wrapper source code is located in the "src" folder, however the netbeans IDE can open it as an entire project.
