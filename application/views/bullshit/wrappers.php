  What are the wrappers?
</h2>
<p>
  The wrappers are portions of code which should make youre life easier through giving you key portions of your bot (such as the socket connector). This is not a competition on programming after all as much as it is a competition based on the logic you implement for your bot. We want you to be able to hit the ground running and get something going quickly not spend a lot of time fighting errors attempting to connect to our system.

<p>
  Below are a few wrappers which we have provided for you. However, if you feel you must you can always write one for yourself which will, of course, take more time to complete.
